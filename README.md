An image format for retro-style images

I made this format so that you can make your own image with a hex editor for a retro-ish
artstyle. In the future I may need to create an editor to allow making larger images easily.

:warning: This image format is *not* for color accuracy, storage efficiency, or honestly anything
useful. I went through part of an SNES programming tutorial and was inspired by the idea of
manually writing a sprite's data using a hex editor. If there is any useful feature, it is
that this image format can easily be manually written by anyone knowledgable of binary numbers.

## File

### Contents

#### Header

Each file should start with a header to provide some information about the image.
The first 7 *bytes* are `"IMRETRO"` (for a total of 56 bits). This is the file signature.

The next two bits map to the "modes" that declare the bits-per-pixel. `00` for 1-bit, `01` for
2-bit, and `10` for 8-bit. After is a single bit for palette usage: `0` for no palette, `1` to
declare that the file contains a palette. When no palette is present in the file, this means that
the file decoder should choose its own default palette. The next 5 bits are unused.

Following that are 32 bits for the dimensions: 16 for width and 16 for height. The reason for this limited
range of dimensions is to be faithful to the retro-ish goal of this format.

This results in 12 bytes for the header.

#### Palette (Optional)

The palette will declare the possible colors in the image. The number of colors in your
palette depend on the number of bits you chose to use in your header. In 1-Bit mode, you
will declare 2 colors, in 2-Bit mode, 4 colors, etc. Each color in the palette will be 4 bytes:
RGB and an alpha value. So, in 8-Bit mode, with 256 possible colors, the palette will be 1024
bytes.

#### Pixels

After the header comes the actual declaration of the pixels. The number of bits used in each
pixel will depend on the "mode" you chose. Only 1 bit for each pixel in 1-Bit mode, 2 bits in
2-Bit mode, etc. Each value for each pixel maps to a color in the palette.

##### Bit Order

When multiple pixels are stored in a single byte, the bits are used from *left to right*.
For example, if a byte in 2-bit mode contains the pixels values `1 2 3` and the remaining 2 bits are
unused (this can happen when the number of pixels is not a multiple of 8), then the byte would be
`01101100`. This style is used so that unused bits can simply be left as `0`, and so that the bits
can be read from left to right.

### Modes

#### 1-Bit Mode

This mode has only two colors: off and on.

##### Default

The default palette is for "off" to be black and "on" to be white, like you
might expect from a Pong console.

#### 2-Bit Mode

This mode has four colors: off, light, strong, and full.

##### Default

#### 8-Bit Mode

256 colors.

##### Default

For the nth color, where n is in \[0, 256\), the RGBA values are `n & 3`, `n >> 2 & 3`,
`n >> 4 & 3`, and `n >> 6 & 3`. In other words, if `n` is represented as a byte, then `r` is the
smallest 2 bits, `g` is the next 2 bits, etc.
The first 64 colors are completely transparent, but technically have different RGB values.
